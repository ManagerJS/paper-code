Not brain teasers. Fair programming challenges for quickly getting a feel for a candidate's style and speed.

Here are some of the challenges I've used and found useful.  I'm not finished refining my interviewing process, but I have had good results with these challenges so they are good enough to share.

## Classic CS Type Problems

As I flesh out this list I will turn the list items into links to the actual problem details.

+ [Fibonacci](fibonacci/)
+ [Whole Root](whole-root/)
+ Reverse a String
+ Palendrome Detection
+ [Memoization](memoize/)

## Story Type Problems

+ [Secret Santa](secret-santa/)
